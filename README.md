# SafeSites

## Purpose
Oftentimes people find Airbnb properties that are located in sketchy parts of town and we want to help people enjoy their stay at a property without worrying about their safety. SafeSites is a website intended to find optimal rental properties based on the userâ€™s preferred location, budget, rental dates, number of people staying at the property, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, pet accommodations, and other factors. The key feature of this application is that it accounts for crime data throughout the US and will rank the available properties based on the crime rate of the county, prioritizing safety first when presenting options.
